I recently read a book called " Kamienie na szaniec " by Aleksander Kamiński. The work has a form similar to a documentary account of events, it features authentic characters. As a curiosity, I would like to add that the author took the title of the work from one of the main characters of the story. "Kamienie na szaniec" was created on the basis of a diary kept by a scout named Zośka. The boy wrote in it his observations on the activities of Polish troops during the Second World War. The action of the book takes place in the years 1939-1945. It begins when a few friends, scouts, including Alek, Zośka and Rudy, are finishing high school. Stefan Batory.</p>
						<p>The joy of receiving a high school diploma is interrupted by the German aggression against Poland and the outbreak of the war. Unexpectedly, young people, who until recently dreamed of long journeys and had beautiful plans for the future, were forced to live in an extremely difficult reality. The boys decide to actively participate in the fight against enemy troops, initially they take part in the so-called "Little Sabotage" later, due to their merits, they are incorporated into the "Polish Assault Groups". They show great tactical skills, with time they take command of individual brigades of soldiers. A great transformation takes place in young men, the author shows how, as a result of tragic events, the heroes change from boys to fully mature and rational men. They are characterized by enormous willpower,</p>
						<p>		
							Some of the events presented in the book seem unbearable for a man of their age. The heroes live in conditions of great poverty, among the rubble of a city ruined by constant bombing, in constant fear for what the next day will bring. They are extremely brave and brave, during the action they are characterized by great organization, the ability to accurately assess the situation and the ability to make decisions in the most extreme conditions. It should be emphasized that the book characters never forget about their youthful ideals and their own desires. Of course, they are aware of the seriousness of the situation in which they find themselves, but they try to distance themselves as far as possible from themselves the thought of the constantly imminent danger. The book finale does not bring a happy solution.
						<p>
							" Kamienie na szaniec " is a touching story about the great ideals of brotherhood, sacrifice and service to defend one's country. It shows the attitudes of a few young men who do not give up in the face of war and take an active, very difficult fight with the enemy.
